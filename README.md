## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to control a NEMA 17 stepper motor using an Arduino Uno and an A4988 stepper driver module. A potentiometer is used to control the direction and rotation of the stepper motor in real-time. NEMA 17 stepper motors are widely used in robotics, CNC machines, 3D printers, and automation systems due to their high torque and precise control capabilities.

### Additional Connections

- **Capacitor (47µF):** Connect across VMOT and GND of A4988

## Installation

### Hardware Setup

1. Connect the A4988 driver module to Arduino as per the pin connection table above
2. Connect the NEMA 17 stepper motor wires to the A4988 driver (1A, 1B, 2A, 2B)
3. Connect the 12V external power supply to VMOT and GND of A4988
4. Add a 47µF capacitor between VMOT and GND for voltage spike protection
5. Connect the potentiometer to analog pin A0
6. Ensure all ground connections are common

### Software Setup

1. Download and install the Arduino IDE from [arduino.cc](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
2. Download the Stepper Motor Library from [GitHub](https://github.com/arduino-libraries/Stepper)
3. Install the library in Arduino IDE:
   - Go to **Sketch → Include Library → Add .ZIP Library**
   - Select the downloaded library file

## Code Explanation

### Library Inclusion and Constants

```cpp
#include <Stepper.h>
#define STEPS 200  // Steps per revolution for NEMA 17
```

The Stepper library is included, and the number of steps per revolution (200) is defined.

### Motor Initialization

```cpp
Stepper stepper(STEPS, 2, 3);  // Pin 2: DIRECTION, Pin 3: STEP
#define motorInterfaceType 1
```

A Stepper object is created with 200 steps, connected to pins 2 and 3.

### Setup Function

```cpp
void setup() {
  stepper.setSpeed(1000);  // Set motor speed in RPM
}
```

The motor speed is set to 1000 RPM. NEMA 17's maximum speed is 4688 RPM, but torque drops quickly above 1000 RPM.

### Main Loop

```cpp
void loop() {
  potVal = map(analogRead(A0), 0, 1024, 0, 500);
  
  if (potVal > Pval)
    stepper.step(10);    // Move 10 steps clockwise
    
  if (potVal < Pval)
    stepper.step(-10);   // Move 10 steps counter-clockwise
    
  Pval = potVal;
}
```

The potentiometer value is read and mapped. If the current value is higher than the previous value, the motor moves clockwise; if lower, it moves counter-clockwise.

## How It Works

1. **Initialization:** The Arduino initializes the stepper motor with 200 steps per revolution and sets the speed to 1000 RPM.

2. **Potentiometer Reading:** The Arduino continuously reads the analog value from the potentiometer (0-1023) and maps it to a range of 0-500.

3. **Direction Control:**
   - When you rotate the potentiometer clockwise, the current value increases, and the motor rotates clockwise in 10-step increments.
   - When you rotate the potentiometer counter-clockwise, the current value decreases, and the motor rotates counter-clockwise in 10-step increments.

4. **Motor Movement:** The A4988 driver translates the STEP and DIRECTION signals from Arduino into the appropriate phase currents to drive the stepper motor.

## Usage

### Uploading the Code

1. Open the Arduino IDE
2. Copy the complete code into a new sketch
3. Select the correct **Board** (Arduino UNO) from **Tools → Board**
4. Select the correct **Port** from **Tools → Port**
5. Click the **Upload** button

### Operating the System

1. Power on the 12V supply and Arduino
2. Rotate the potentiometer clockwise to move the motor clockwise
3. Rotate the potentiometer counter-clockwise to move the motor counter-clockwise
4. The motor will respond to potentiometer movements in real-time

### Complete Arduino Code

```cpp
#include <Stepper.h>
#define STEPS 200

// Define stepper motor connections and motor interface type
// Motor interface type must be set to 1 when using a driver
Stepper stepper(STEPS, 2, 3); // Pin 2: DIRECTION, Pin 3: STEP
#define motorInterfaceType 1

int Pval = 0;
int potVal = 0;

void setup() {
  // Set the maximum speed in steps per second:
  stepper.setSpeed(1000);
}

void loop() {
  potVal = map(analogRead(A0), 0, 1024, 0, 500);
  
  if (potVal > Pval)
    stepper.step(10);
    
  if (potVal < Pval)
    stepper.step(-10);
    
  Pval = potVal;
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Motor Not Moving

- Check all power connections (12V supply to VMOT)
- Verify Arduino is powered and code is uploaded
- Ensure all ground connections are common
- Check stepper motor wire connections to A4988

### Motor Moving Erratically

- Add or increase capacitor value (47µF or higher)
- Check for loose connections
- Reduce motor speed in code
- Ensure adequate power supply current (at least 2A)

### Motor Getting Hot

- Reduce motor speed
- Check if current limiting is set correctly on A4988
- Ensure proper ventilation around motor and driver
- Use a heatsink on the A4988 driver

### Weak Torque

- Increase supply voltage (up to 12V for NEMA 17)
- Adjust current limiting potentiometer on A4988
- Reduce motor speed
- Check for mechanical obstructions

## Applications

This project can be used in various applications:

- **3D Printers:** Precise axis control
- **CNC Machines:** Tool positioning
- **Robotics:** Robotic arm joints
- **Camera Sliders:** Smooth motion control
- **Automated Curtains:** Window automation
- **Antenna Rotators:** HF magnetic loop positioning
- **Conveyor Systems:** Material handling
- **Laboratory Equipment:** Sample positioning

## Customization Options

### Changing Microstepping Resolution

To use quarter-step mode for finer control:

```cpp
// Connect MS1 to Arduino pin 4, MS2 to pin 5
pinMode(4, OUTPUT);
pinMode(5, OUTPUT);
digitalWrite(4, LOW);   // MS1 = Low
digitalWrite(5, HIGH);  // MS2 = High
digitalWrite(6, LOW);   // MS3 = Low (if connected)
```

Update steps per revolution:
```cpp
#define STEPS 800  // 200 steps × 4 (quarter-step) = 800
```

### Adjusting Speed

For slower, more precise movement:
```cpp
stepper.setSpeed(100);  // Slower speed for precision
```

### Changing Step Increment

For smoother control:
```cpp
if (potVal > Pval)
  stepper.step(1);  // Move 1 step at a time
```

## Safety Precautions

⚠️ **Important Safety Notes:**

- Never disconnect the motor while it's powered
- Ensure proper heat dissipation for A4988 driver
- Use appropriate power supply ratings
- Double-check polarity before powering on
- Keep motor and driver away from moisture
- Use wire gauges appropriate for current ratings
